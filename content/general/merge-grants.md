Merge Grant is a micro-grant initiative designed to give ambitious builders resources as they pursue compelling projects.

Weâ€™re run by [Merge Club](http://merge.club/) members â€” called Mergers â€” who review applications, conduct interviews and make grant decisions.

We give you money (between \$50 and \$1,000) and support for your ideaâ€”no strings attached.

We get no equity, ownership, or future right to invest. Youâ€™ll also get perks (hosting credits, etc) and an invite to join Merge Club.
