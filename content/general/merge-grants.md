## Mission

Merge Grant is a micro-grant initiative designed to give ambitious builders resources as they pursue compelling projects. We're run by [Merge Club](http://merge.club/) members — called Mergers — who review applications, conduct interviews and make grant decisions.

We give you money (between $50 and $1,000) and support for your idea—no strings attached. We get no equity, ownership, or future right to invest. You'll also get perks (hosting credits, etc) and an invite to join Merge Club.
