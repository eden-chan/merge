# Finding the Right Grant for You

General grants are a great starting point for builders looking for non-dilutive funding. These programs typically have broader criteria and fewer restrictions compared to specialized grants, making them accessible to a wider range of projects and founders.

## How to Choose

When evaluating general grants, consider:

1. **Funding Amount**: Match the grant size to your needs. Some programs like Emergent Ventures offer larger amounts ($1k-$50k), while others like Bagel Fund provide smaller grants ($100-$500) that are perfect for early experiments.

2. **Application Process**: 
   - Some grants have rolling applications (Merge Grant, Bagel Fund)
   - Others have specific cohort deadlines (1517 Fund)
   - Consider the time investment required for each application

3. **Focus Areas**: While these are "general" grants, each has subtle preferences:
   - Emergent Ventures: Ambitious, contrarian ideas
   - 1517 Fund: Young founders, technical projects
   - Merge Grant: Early-stage experiments and prototypes
   - Bagel Fund: Small, focused projects

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Consider applying to smaller grants first (like Merge Grant or Bagel Fund) to build a track record

2. **Be Specific**: Even for general grants, clearly outline:
   - Exactly how you'll use the money
   - Your timeline and milestones
   - Why this amount makes sense for your project

3. **Show Progress**: Most programs favor:
   - Working prototypes over ideas
   - Evidence of user interest
   - Clear next steps after funding

4. **Build Relationships**: Follow grant providers on social media, engage with their content, and understand their mission before applying
