## Program Overview

What is Bagel Fund? We're a friend group working in tech that wants to support young people working on cool ideas.

We give microgrants ($100-500) to ambitious young builders.

### What We Love to See

1. Budgets that demonstrate research, resourcefulness, and skill
2. Real problems that need scrappy solutions
3. Projects that can go from 0 to 1 with <$500

### What We Don't Fund

1. Budgets with vague requests, ad/subscription money, or fiver/contractor funds
2. Non-unique AI wrappers, product dupes, or social clubs
3. Projects with existing grants, VC money, or where applicants can make $500 themselves

Working on something cool and need some non-dilutive ideation capital? Fill out this short [form](https://airtable.com/apppHgxMD5RiaGBXT/pagbMa5Y4OIVsL3nM/form). We'll get back to you via email if it's a good fit.

##  Application Guide

**Tell us about a project you led. What was your biggest mistake & what did you learn from it?**\*

**What are you building now & why does it matter?**\*

Past recipients were building UAVs, gene-editing plants for longevity, energy-saving smart home platforms, and more. Lead with the problem, its significance, and how your solution is the best.

**How much money are you requesting?**\*

We fund up to $500.

**Please provide an itemized budget.**\*

Feel free to highlight needs vs. wants. Paying others to do your work (Fiver contractors, web developers, etc) should never be under "needs".

**What will the $ help you achieve?**\*

Think about what specific goals or benchmarks the funds should get you to.

**What are your plans for future funding?**

We love funding builders who are working on projects simply because they want to learn and make an impact while doing so. Oftentimes, Bagel Fund is the first grant our applicants have ever applied for. With anything, googling "best practices for X" can get you really far. But to make things easier, check out our [Model Grant Application](https://ak-columbia.notion.site/Bagel-Fund-Model-Grant-Application-10e0cfd9eaa3809cb220ef06b4d4ca17) with snippets from other first-time grant writers who received funding for their projects. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot an email to [alexa@kayman.ventures](mailto:alexa@kayman.ventures).
